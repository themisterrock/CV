        <p>I decided early last year that I wanted to return to the industry and pick up my career after a lengthy period of absence from the development side of IT. To get back on track to my full potential I have accepted that my knowledge would need upgrading, therefore I enrolled on a programming bootcamp with The App Brewery London for Full Stack Web Development and found that it built on my understanding of HTML, CSS, and Java incredibly well. It has also introduced me to tools such as Bootstrap, jQuery, GitHub, Node, Express, API’s, MongoDB and React, as well as others.
    This newfound knowledge has left me even more eager to return to a career I enjoy, as well as being more than competent at. This year I have also started distance learning courses in software development to try and stay ahead of the curve and am currently studying C++, Python and UE5’s Blueprint Visual Scripting.
    My experience of working within the industry was some time ago, however my self-development within IT and my drive for programming is current and up to date. Development tools and technologies are constantly evolving, and I am excited to be a part of that journey. </p></td>
